  "body": "### Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO) in Fortran\r\nThis code is the Fortran 90 implementation of the Multi-Objective Particle Swarm\r\n Optimization (MOPSO). To learn more about it you can refer to:\r\n\tC. A. C. Coello, G. T. Pulido and M. S. Lechuga, \"Handling multiple \r\n\t\tobjectives with particle swarm optimization\" in IEEE Transactions on \r\n\t\tEvolutionary Computation, vol. 8, no. 3, pp. 256-279, June 2004.\r\n\tMargarita Reyes-sierra and Carlos A. Coello Coello, \"Multi-Objective \r\n\t\tparticle swarm optimizers: A survey of the state-of-the-art\" in \r\n\t\tINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE RESEARCH,\r\n\t\tvol. 2, no. 3, pp. 287-308, 2006\r\n### How to use?\r\nTo run the code you simply need to do 3 things:\r\n1) modify or create an INCLUDE file in the folder called /in. look at one of the\r\n\tsamples and make one for your own problem. \r\n2) make sure the solver you defined in the include file (line~83) exists in the\r\n\tProblemBank.f90. The objective functions and constraints must be defined there\r\n3) change the INCLUDE file in the MOPSO.f90. to the one you created/modified.\r\n\r\n The sample problems are taken for the following book:\r\n\t\"Evolutionary Algorithms for Solving Multi-Objective Problems\" by \r\n\tCarlos Coello Coello, Gary B. Lamont and David A. van Veldhuizen\r\n\ttake a look at sample problems on page Chapter 4, page 183-...\r\n\r\nto run simply:\r\n$ make\r\n$ ./main\r\n\r\nThe results will be written in the out/ProbName folder (where ProbName is the \r\nname you chose for your problem at the problem INCLUDE file line: 45). 'PS.dat' and 'PF.dat'\r\n contain the Pareto set (points on design space) and Pareto front \r\n (corresponding objective values). The other output might -depending on \r\n your problem setup- be a 'log.dat' file which inlcudes some report of the\r\n events in the simulation time including timing of different parts of the\r\n code (helpful for debugging) and intermediate solutions 'progress.dat'\r\n that includes the archive contents as the generations evolve.\r\nPlease feel free to contact me if you have any questions.\r\n\tYousef Naranjani (@ynaranjani)\r\n\tyo.na1118@gmail.com\r\n\tApril 2016\r\n",
